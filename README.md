# Fashion MNIST using TensorFlow Keras

Using the 'Fashion' dataset available from MNIST, a deep neural network is employed to classify a test image of a clothing artifact to its correct category.
Playing around with the number of input layers/convolutional layers give us a general idea about how a (C)NN works, and how the loss and accuracy of the classification process gets affected. The 'callback' function is adopted from L. Maroney's Coursera course.
